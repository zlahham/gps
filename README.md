## Satellite Navigation System

This a simple route calculation program. The program guides a driver around a network of one way streets, with crossroads that are named A-E. For example AB4 represents a road from A to B (but not from B to A), with a length of 4.

This ultimately calculates the length of a given route, the number of possible routes between two points, and the shortest route between two points.
